This is a 2d game written in c that only depends on SDL2.

#notes
SDL stands for simple direct media player.  It is a low level graphics library.
This is mainly just a test program to get an idea of what goes into making a game 
from scratch.  This was developed and ran in a fedora virtual box with 2048 MB of ram.


#installation
https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/Installation <- SDL install instructions.
Once you have SDL2 installed you 'make' and './bin/exec'.  Do not 'cd bin; ./exec';
That completely breaks everything because the path's to the bitmap image dirs are wrong.
A design oversight to say the least.  Ontop of SDL2 you will need gcc and cmake.
